<p>This page is still under construction and will be complete within 4 days or so. To get started,you can simply grab a copy of our system, test it and tell us what you think about it. We will be more than happy to receive your perception about the e-hospital system. You are welcome and stay updated for more information to come along. Thanx</p>

<p>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages</p>

<pre><code>
If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
Currently only one contributor exists for this project. It's Olupot Douglas (@olupotd) and you too can join the list and be apart of something bigger.
